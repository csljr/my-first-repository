## And My First Commit
When you modify your code, you are creating changes to a text file.<br>
The text file has no memory of when, why, or how you made your changes,<br>
it just reflects the latest version. When you tell git that you want to<br>
commit changes, git analyzes the difference between the text file now<br>
and your last commit. (It stores these changes in a highly compressed<br>
way.)

Using "commit" as a noun: think of it like the words "revision" or<br>
"version". A single point in the git history. The entire history<br>
of a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits. 

Using "commit" as a verb: the action of storing a new snapshot of<br>
your project's state in the git history.

Commits create a transparent history of your work that others can follow<br>
to undertand what you've done and why. Each commit has an associated<br>
commit messsage, which is a description explaining why a particular<br>
change was made. Commit messages are important, especially since git<br>
tracks your changes and then displays them as commits once they're<br>
pushed to the server. By writing clear commit messages, you can make<br>
it easier for other people to follow along and provide feedback.

Each commit is considered a separate unit of change. This lets you<br>
roll back changes if a bug is found, or if you decide to head in a<br>
different direction.
